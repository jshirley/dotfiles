# Jay's Dotfiles

This is a collection of dotfiles, heavily borrowed and influenced by many before me.

## The Fish Shell

I use the fish shell, and it's a good shell. It tries to manage fish shell resources in a reasonable way.

You can put functions in ~/.dotfiles/fish/functions/ and they'll be symlinked into the ~/.config/fish/functions
directory as you would expect. Or hopefully, but with cold-blooded software you can never be sure.

## Setup

1. Clone into ~/.dotfiles
2. Run ~/.dotfiles/script/install
3. Run ~/.dotfiles/script/bootstrap

I'm sure there are many, many ways to improve on this. If you know of any, please let me know by filing an issue or
submitting a PR.
